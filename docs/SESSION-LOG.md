# Session log

Append-only handover notes. Context does not survive between Claude Code sessions — this file is what
does. Newest at the bottom. Written with `/session-log`.

---

## 2026-08-26 — Project set up, no code yet

**Done:** Repository scaffolding only — CLAUDE.md, seven path-scoped rules, four skills, three
subagents, four hooks, the docs, and eleven task files. No solution, no projects, no code.

**Files that matter:** `tasks/README.md` is the work queue and the only place status lives.
`docs/SPEC.md` is the contract. `docs/DOMAIN.md` holds the business rules and the worked example
every test validates against.

**Decisions made:**
- RFQ-to-quotation chosen because the loop closes on itself — an enquiry arrives, a quotation leaves,
  nothing obviously missing around it.
- Architecture is a **fixed pipeline with one autonomous stage**. Extract → Resolve → Price → Approve
  never reorders. Autonomy lives only inside Resolve. Price is C#. This is deliberate and is the main
  thing to be able to explain.
- **EF Core, not Dapper** — more common in job descriptions, and migrations are a demonstrable thing.
  `AsNoTracking()` on all reads; entities never leave `QuoteDesk.Data`.
- Pricing lives in a dependency-free `QuoteDesk.Domain` so it can be shown to be untouched by the LLM.
- Intake is one `IncomingEnquiry` record with three adapters, shipped in risk order: paste, email
  (IMAP), WhatsApp (Twilio sandbox). Meta Cloud API is optional and off the critical path.
- **Audio is not transcribed.** Voice notes are stored and played; the enquiry is marked
  `needs_manual_entry`. Images may be read by a multimodal model on the gemini profile, optionally,
  in task 09.
- **Gemini is the default provider** (Harsh already has a key). ~1000+ requests/day, enough for the
  public demo and for repeated eval runs, and it reads images so one key covers every channel.
  GitHub Models stays configured as a fallback and a control. Azure is the deploy target only —
  free-tier subscription, no Azure OpenAI.
- Task 00 added: a throwaway twenty-minute spike proving tool calling works on the Gemini key before
  anything depends on it. If streaming plus tools is broken there, the fallback is to run the tool
  loop non-streaming and stream only the final narration — the trace panel is driven by server
  AgentEvents, not model tokens, so the UI is unaffected.

**Known gaps:** Everything. Start at task 01.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing. The Gemini key and the Azure subscription are already in hand. A
mailbox with an app password is needed for the email adapter in task 09, and a Twilio account for
WhatsApp in the same task — neither blocks anything before then, and task 09 ships email first
deliberately.

**Next:** Task 00 — environment, repo and provider spike. This is the only command needed to start:
`/task 00`.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Task 00 (parts 1–3 done, 4–5 outstanding)

**Done:** The plan was read and challenged; 22 findings raised and four decisions taken (below).
Repo initialised, 44 files in one local commit `57b55e3 chore: project setup`. **Not pushed** — see
"Blocked". Hooks made executable and the exec bit forced into the git index with
`git update-index --chmod=+x`, since Windows leaves `core.filemode` unset and the plain `chmod`
recorded nothing. Added `.gitattributes` because `core.autocrlf=true` would hand the hook scripts
CRLF endings on re-checkout and break bash.

**Files that matter:** `docs/SPEC.md` §7 and `docs/DOMAIN.md` — both need the schema edits agreed
today and not yet written. `tasks/task-00-environment.md` still reads `todo`.

**Decisions made:**
- **Schema gaps get fixed before task 02**, not after. SPEC §7 cannot store the worked example's
  approved outcome: `Quotes` needs `ShipTo`/`RequiredBy`/`Freight`/`ValidUntil`; `QuoteLines` needs
  `RequiresOverride`/`MarginShortfallPct`/`DispatchDate`/`DeliveryDate`; `Customers` needs
  `ShipToZone`; and `EnquiryAttachments`, `Approvals` and `WorkflowCheckpoints` do not exist at all.
- **`PriceRules` holds quantity slabs only**, loaded by a repository and passed into
  `SlabDiscountPolicy` as a parameter — Domain has zero references and cannot read a database. Tier
  percentages, the 10% margin floor, 18% GST, 15-day validity, freight zones and the holiday calendar
  are constants in Domain. Cost accepted: changing a holiday is a code change, not a data edit.
- **The spike also probes workflow suspend/resume**, not just tool calling. That risk was otherwise
  untested until task 06.
- **Never run `git commit` or `git push`** — stage and propose the message; Harsh commits. Applies in
  auto mode too. The history is part of the portfolio.

**Agent Framework, confirmed by `api-researcher`:** packages are GA and target `net10.0`;
`Microsoft.Agents.AI` and `.OpenAI` are both **1.19.0**, so SPEC §4's "1.5.0" is stale. SPEC §5's
`AsAIAgent` snippet is correct as written. Tools attach per agent instance via
`ChatClientAgentOptions.ChatOptions.Tools`, so two disjoint registries genuinely work. Human-in-the-loop
is first-class: `WorkflowBuilder` + `RequestPort.Create<TReq,TResp>` + `RequestInfoEvent` +
`handle.SendResponseAsync`. Checkpointing ships `FileSystemJsonCheckpointStore` and `CosmosCheckpointStore`
but **no SQL store** — task 06 should implement `ICheckpointStore<JsonElement>` over the
`WorkflowCheckpoints` table. Rehydration needs a stable `ChatClientAgentOptions.Id` per agent.
`RunStreamingAsync` yields message-level `AgentRunResponseUpdate`s, **not token deltas**, so SPEC §9's
`token` event will be chunkier than the UI design assumes. No official `IChatClient` test double exists;
task 06 writes its own fake.

**Known gaps:** `jq` is **not installed**, so `guard-paths.sh` and `guard-bash.sh` both `exit 0` and
protect nothing — SETUP.md's "hooks are law" is false until it is. Docker daemon not running. The
Gemini key is set nowhere. Parts 4 and 5 of task 00 are untouched: no spike has run, so the streaming
verdict is still unknown, and the SPEC/DOMAIN edits above are still unwritten.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Install `jq` (`winget install jqlang.jq`) and restart Claude Code. Start Docker
Desktop. Decide whether local commit `57b55e3` stays or is undone with `git reset --soft HEAD~1`.
Set the Gemini key via `dotnet user-secrets` once the spike project exists.

**Next:** Finish task 00 — parts 4 and 5. The spike settles the one genuine unknown (tool calling on
Gemini, streaming and not) before anything depends on it.

## 2026-08-29 — Setup simplification (no task number)

**Done:** Cut the Claude Code configuration from 19 files to 4 and the instruction docs from ~1,600
lines to ~700. All hooks removed at Harsh's instruction — the two guard hooks were inert anyway
(no `jq`), and `settings.json`'s `deny` list enforces the same protections through the harness,
which cannot fail open. `.claude/rules/` deleted entirely; its content merged into `CLAUDE.md`,
which is now the single always-loaded instruction file. `dotnet-reviewer` and `spec-auditor`
removed in favour of the built-in `/code-review`. `/verify-all` and `/adr` removed — the three
verification commands are written into `CLAUDE.md` and the task skill directly. `SETUP.md` deleted
(it claimed "hooks are law", which was false).

**Deploy moved from task 11 to task 09.** Channels became 10; observability, evals and the README
became 11. `SPEC.md` trimmed to what sessions 1–2 actually build.

**Files that matter:** `CLAUDE.md` (everything always-loaded now lives here), `tasks/README.md`
(new order and the reasoning), `tasks/task-09-deploy.md` (new).

**Decisions made:** Ship the paste path to a public URL as soon as it works, before channels,
telemetry or evals. The previous project (WebLibrary) was never finished, so momentum risk outranks
completeness. Process and scaffolding count as scope and were cut on the same grounds.

**Known gaps:** No `.cs` file exists yet. Docker daemon not running. The Gemini key is set nowhere.
Task 00 parts 4 and 5 are untouched — no spike has run, so the streaming verdict is still unknown.
`jq` is no longer needed by anything.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Start Docker Desktop. Have the Gemini API key ready for `dotnet user-secrets`
once the spike project exists. Decide whether local commit `57b55e3` stays or is undone.

**Next:** Task 00, parts 4 and 5 — the provider spike. It settles the one genuine unknown (tool
calling on Gemini, streaming and not) before anything depends on it.

## 2026-08-29 — Task 00, parts 1–3 (still `in progress`)

**Done:** Machine verified green — .NET SDK 10.0.302, Node v24.16.0, Docker 29.6.1 with the daemon
**running** (it was down last session), git 2.50.1, `dotnet-ef` 10.0.8 already installed. Nothing is
missing; no installs are outstanding.

Gemini key validated against `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` — HTTP 200
on `GET /models`. The account reaches far more than the spec assumed: `gemini-2.5-flash`/`-pro`,
`gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.1-pro`. Recorded in SPEC.md §4, along with the rule
to pin an exact model id rather than the `gemini-flash-latest` alias, which would break eval
reproducibility.

Spike project scaffolded at `<scratchpad>/spike` — .NET 10 console, `OpenAI` **2.13.0**. Outside the
repo, so it cannot be committed by accident. `Program.cs` is not written yet.

**Files that matter:** `docs/SPEC.md` §4 (verified provider findings), `tasks/task-00-environment.md`
(parts 4–5 remain), `CLAUDE.md`.

**Decisions made:** API signatures are verified by grepping the installed package's XML docs under
`~/.nuget/packages/`, not by spawning the `api-researcher` subagent — the docs are exact for the
resolved version and cost one command. The subagent is now reserved for behavioural questions
(can a workflow resume after a process restart, preview status, provider quirks), expected once in
the whole project. `CLAUDE.md` and the task skill were updated to say so.

**Known gaps:** **The provider spike has not run.** The streaming-plus-tool-calls verdict is still
unknown — the one genuine unknown in the project. No model id chosen yet. No `.cs` file in the repo.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing. The key works and the machine is ready.

**Next:** Task 00 parts 4 and 5 — write the spike `Program.cs`, run it non-streaming and streaming,
record the verdict, delete the spike. Roughly twenty minutes, and task 01 should not start before it.

**Note:** the API key was pasted into the chat transcript. Rotate it in Google AI Studio once the
demo is finished.

## 2026-08-29 — Task 00 done

**Done:** Environment fully verified (.NET 10.0.302, Node 24.16, Docker 29.6.1 daemon up, git,
`dotnet-ef`). Provider spike ran and answered the one real unknown: on the Gemini OpenAI-compat
layer, non-streaming tool calls work end to end; streaming tool calls fail with `400` because
Gemini's 3.x thinking models require a `thought_signature` on replayed function-call parts that the
OpenAI wire schema has no field for — confirmed with a raw curl repro, so it's a real protocol gap,
not our bug. Task 00 is `done`.

**Files that matter:** `docs/SPEC.md` §4 (pinned model, full verdict and reasoning),
`tasks/task-00-environment.md` (Notes on completion).

**Decisions made:** Pin `gemini-3.6-flash` — `gemini-2.5-flash` (the id SPEC.md originally assumed)
is `404` for new keys, retired by Google. Tool-calling loop in `QuoteDesk.Agents` runs non-streaming
everywhere; only the closing narration streams. No architecture change — the trace panel already
runs on server-emitted `AgentEvent`s, not model tokens, so this was the fallback SPEC.md already
planned for.

**Known gaps:** No `.cs` file exists yet — task 01 is the first real code. Spike deleted, nothing
left in the scratchpad.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing.

**Next:** Task 01 — setup and skeleton. Build the solution and the six projects per `CLAUDE.md`'s
layout, wired `Api → Agents → Data → Domain`, `Intake → Api`, before any real logic.

## 2026-08-29 — Tasks 01 + 03 + 02 done (built together, deliberately)

**Done:** Solution builds clean under `-warnaserror` (5 source + 3 test projects, `Api → Agents →
Data → Domain` and `Api → Intake → Data`). SQL Server runs via `docker-compose.yml` and is migrated.
Every pricing rule in `docs/DOMAIN.md` is implemented in `QuoteDesk.Domain` and proven — including a
single test reproducing the Shreeji Textiles worked example exactly (8% discount, 14% margin, belt
missing its date). The database is seeded deterministically (25 customers, 262 catalogue items, 1,200
order-history rows, 12 enquiries) with all six deliberate cases individually queryable. Vite/React
health-check page confirmed working end to end against the live Api through the dev-server proxy. 35
unit tests + 14 real-container integration tests, all passing.

**Files that matter:** `CLAUDE.md` (dependency-graph line, corrected), `docs/DOMAIN.md` ("The
numbers, filled in by task 03"), `src/QuoteDesk.Data/Seed/DeterministicSeeder.cs`.

**Decisions made:** Built 01+03+02 in one sitting, not separately — justified because all three are
foundation with zero external unknowns, and task 03 was done *before* 02 (its own "depends on 02" is
wrong: Domain has no references at all). Google OpenID Connect replaces the JWT-bearer plan for task
07 (Harsh's instruction; `docs/SPEC.md` §3 and task 07 updated). Docker Desktop's containerd
snapshotter was breaking every pull from `mcr.microsoft.com`; fixed by disabling it in Docker
Desktop's own settings — a machine-local toggle, not a repo change.

**Known gaps:** Seed data is 262 catalogue items / 16 price rules, not the spec's ~300 / ~40 —
documented as a deliberate simplification in task 02's Notes on completion. `IEnquiryRepository` is
read-only; task 04 adds the write path.

**Committed:** `142d0c3` on `development`, local only (not pushed). Re-verified build/tests
immediately before committing — still 0 warnings, 49/49 tests passing. `QuoteDesk.Web`'s
`node_modules` and `dist` are gitignored as usual; nothing else was left uncommitted.

**Machine state for next session:** SQL Server container (`quotedesk-sql`) is up and seeded — no
need to re-run `docker compose up -d` or the `--seed` flag unless the volume is removed. To browse
the data directly (SSMS / Azure Data Studio / VS Code's mssql extension): server `localhost,1433`,
SQL auth, login `sa`, password `QuoteDesk!Local1` (the `docker-compose.yml` local-dev default, not a
real secret), check "Trust server certificate".

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing.

**Next:** Task 04 — intake abstraction and paste adapter.

## 2026-08-29 — Task 04a: Google sign-in and a Users table

**Done:** React gets a Google ID token and posts it to `POST /api/auth/google`; the Api verifies it
against Google, auto-provisions a `Users` row keyed on the `sub` claim, and mints its own bearer JWT.
Every route requires that token by default via a fallback authorization policy — `/health/*` and
`/api/auth/google` are the only exceptions. Verified live: `/health/live` → 200, `/api/auth/me` with
no token → 401, `/api/auth/google` with a bad token → 401 with a real Google JWKS round-trip and no
exception text in the body. **Also verified through an actual browser**: Harsh signed in with a real
Google account at `localhost:8080`, and the `Users` row landed correctly — `pharshin29@gmail.com`,
role `admin` (matched from `Auth:AdminEmails`), `CreatedAt == LastLoginAt` on first sign-in.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Api/Program.cs` (auth wiring, the fallback-policy line),
`src/QuoteDesk.Api/Auth/`, `tests/QuoteDesk.IntegrationTests/Api/QuoteDeskApiFactory.cs`.

**Decisions made:** Pulled forward from task 07 so every endpoint from task 04 on is protected by
construction. Bearer JWT, not a cookie — the prod split between Static Web Apps and Container Apps
would break cookie auth, and `EventSource` (needed for SSE) can't send an `Authorization` header
either way, so `useAgentStream` will use `fetch`+`ReadableStream` instead (CLAUDE.md updated).
`docs/SPEC.md` §3/§9 and `tasks/task-07-api.md` updated in the same commit — this expands "no user
system to build" by exactly one auto-provisioned table, nothing more.

**Known gaps:** `WebApplicationFactory`'s `ConfigureAppConfiguration` is ineffective here — Program.cs
reads config before `Build()` — so the test factory uses environment variables instead; found and
fixed before it could touch the real dev database. No rate limit on `/api/auth/google` yet (task 07).

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing. (`.claude/settings.json`'s `Read(./.env.*)` deny rule blocked writing
`.env.example` — narrowed to `Read(./.env)` + `Read(./.env.local)` on his explicit instruction;
`.env.example` now exists, `src/QuoteDesk.Web/.env.local` holds the real Client ID he created by hand.)

**Next:** Task 04 — intake abstraction and paste adapter.

## 2026-08-29 — Tasks 04 + 05: intake, paste adapter, and the seven typed tools

**Done:** `POST /api/enquiries` stores a pasted enquiry (behind the task 04a auth policy) via
`QuoteDesk.Intake`'s `PasteAdapter`, blank-body-with-attachments correctly landing on
`needs_manual_entry`. All seven tools from docs/SPEC.md §7 now exist in `QuoteDesk.Agents.Tools` as
plain, fully-tested C# — `search_catalog` resolves "25mm PU belt" cleanly and comes back ambiguous
for "ring frame spindle tape" + "thicker" across all eight seeded thicknesses;
`price_quote` reproduces the worked example's 8%/14% exactly; `create_quote_draft`/`send_quote`
round-trip a quote to `sent` with a `QTN-` number. No agent or LLM call exists yet — these are still
ordinary methods with tests, called directly.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Tools/` (all seven tools + both registries),
`src/QuoteDesk.Intake/PasteAdapter.cs`, `docs/SPEC.md` §6/§7 (three signature corrections, explained
inline), `tasks/task-04-intake.md` and `task-05-tools.md` Notes on completion (full detail).

**Decisions made:** `search_catalog` returns `CatalogSearchResult` not `CatalogMatch[]`;
`price_quote` takes `int? customerId` for the unknown-sender case; `create_quote_draft` returns a
typed `QuoteDraftResult`. `MarginShortfallPct` is never carried past `QuoteDesk.Domain` — only the
`RequiresOverride` bool reaches any tool result or column. `[AIFunctionName]` avoided (marked
`[Experimental("MEAI001")]` in `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions` 10.9.0); tool names set via
`AIFunctionFactoryOptions.Name` instead. Two xUnit test classes hitting the same fixed test-database
name in separate `IClassFixture`s race each other under parallel execution — fixed twice this
session (Api tests, then Repository tests) by sharing one `[Collection(...)]`; **any new test class
using `QuoteDeskApiFactory` or `RepositoryFixture` must join the existing collection, not declare its
own `IClassFixture`.**

**Known gaps:** `Quotes.ShipTo`/`RequiredBy` stay null — no Extract stage exists yet to populate them
(task 06). `EnquiryAttachment` is a shape only, no table — task 10 adds storage when a real channel
can attach a file. No agent, workflow, or prompt exists — task 06 is the first place an LLM is called
outside the task 00 spike.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing.

**Next:** Task 06 — agents and workflow. Wires `ReadToolRegistry` to an actual `AIAgent` for the
Resolve stage; everything it will call already exists and is proven.

## 2026-08-29 — Post-task-05 review: closed a real error-handling gap

**Done:** Harsh asked for a review pass before task 06, specifically about exception handling. Found
`QuoteDesk.Api` had **no global exception handler at all** — any unhandled exception (a DB hiccup, a
malformed request) fell through to ASP.NET Core's raw error response instead of the RFC 9457
`ProblemDetails` CLAUDE.md's Security section requires, and in Development/test it leaked a full
stack trace. Reproduced concretely: two Google sign-ins with the same email but different subjects
throws `DbUpdateException` uncaught by `AuthEndpoints`, which used to 500 with exception text in the
body. Fixed with `builder.Services.AddProblemDetails()` + `app.UseExceptionHandler()` as the first
middleware in the pipeline, and locked in with a new regression test that reproduces exactly that
trigger and asserts the response body contains no exception type, stack frame, or index name. Also
added two missing `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` guards (`CatalogTools.SearchCatalogAsync`'s
`query`/`hints`, `CustomerTools.ResolveCustomerAsync`'s `senderId`) — the only two tool parameters
touched directly (string concatenation, `.IndexOf`) before any null check, unlike every other
array/object parameter this session, which all already guarded consistently.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Api/Program.cs` (the two new lines),
`tests/QuoteDesk.IntegrationTests/Api/GlobalExceptionHandlingTests.cs`.

**Decisions made:** Harsh confirmed mid-review: build the MVP only for now, defer further
production-grade hardening (rate limiting, deeper input validation, etc.) until after it works end to
end — matching the standing `completion-over-sophistication` preference. This exception-handler fix
was treated as in-scope regardless, since it is an explicit CLAUDE.md rule already in force, not new
hardening; no further defensive-programming pass was done beyond the two guards above.

**Known gaps:** Same as the entry above — nothing new introduced by this review. 124/124 tests
passing (94 unit + 30 integration), 0 warnings under `-warnaserror`.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing.

**Next:** Task 06 — agents and workflow, unchanged from above.

## 2026-08-29 — Task 06: agents and workflow

**Done:** The full pipeline runs — Extract → Resolve → Price → suspend at a real `RequestPort` →
Approve — behind `EnquiryPipeline.StartAsync`/`ResumeAsync`. Proven against a stubbed `IChatClient`
scripting the exact docs/DOMAIN.md worked example: real tool calls against the seeded DB resolve the
bearings and belt, the spindle tape stays unresolved (no guess), Price computes the real 8%/14% in
plain C# (never a model call), the run suspends with a `pending_approval` `AgentRun` row, and — via a
second, independent `EnquiryPipeline` sharing only the SQL rows — resuming produces a real `QTN-`
quote. A token-budget test proves a clean `budget_exceeded` with nothing partially written.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Pipeline/` (`EnquiryPipeline`, `QuoteDeskWorkflow`, four
executors), `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Checkpointing/SqlCheckpointStore.cs`,
`tests/QuoteDesk.IntegrationTests/Agents/EnquiryPipelineTests.cs`, `docs/SPEC.md` §3/§4/§6/§7,
`tasks/task-06-agents-workflow.md` Notes on completion (full API-verification detail).

**Decisions made:** `Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI` deliberately not added (build the agent from
`IChatClient` instead — keeps stub-based tests clean). `price_quote` withheld from the Resolve agent;
Price calls `PricingTools` directly. No structured output (`RunAsync<T>`) anywhere — Gemini's
`json_schema` support is unverified, so every call parses fence-tolerant JSON from plain text
(`ModelJson`) uniformly. Real workflow suspension via `RequestPort`, wired with plain `AddEdge` calls
(not `AddExternalCall`, which always loops back to its own source — decompiled and confirmed wrong for
this shape). Three behavioural questions went to `api-researcher` (auto function-invocation and
iteration-cap semantics; routing a `RequestPort`'s response to a different node; resume republishing
the pending request after a restart) — more than the project's usual "once," justified because this
task's own text calls out checkpointing semantics as something to confirm first.

**Known gaps:** `Program.cs` untouched — `AddQuoteDeskAgentPipeline` exists and is proven by tests but
nothing in the running Api calls it; task 07 wires the SSE endpoint and decides whether a missing
`Llm:ApiKey` should fail fast. No live call was made against real `gemini-3.6-flash` — everything is
proven against a stub, per CLAUDE.md. Found and fixed a real concurrency bug along the way: the
workflow's background checkpoint-write and the caller's own DB reaction can't share one scoped
`DbContext` — `WorkflowCheckpointRepository` now uses its own `IDbContextFactory`-sourced context.

**Blocked on Harsh:** One command, whenever convenient (not required for this task's own criteria):
`dotnet user-secrets set "Llm:ApiKey" "<gemini key>" --project src/QuoteDesk.Api` — needed only for a
live end-to-end run against the real model, which would settle whether `gemini-3.6-flash` accepts the
tool-call argument shapes `AIFunctionFactory` expects.

**Next:** Task 07 — API, streaming, auth, logging. Wires `EnquiryPipeline` behind
`POST /api/enquiries/{id}/process` (SSE) and `POST /api/approvals/{id}`, binds `LlmOptions` in
`Program.cs`.

## 2026-08-30 — Task 07: API, streaming, auth, logging

**Done:** `EnquiryPipeline` is reachable over HTTP behind the existing auth policy. `POST
/api/enquiries/{id}/process` and `POST /api/approvals/{id}` (approve/reject) both stream `AgentEvent`s
as SSE through one shared writer that also persists the run's full trace. `GET /api/enquiries/{id}`,
`GET /api/approvals`, `GET /api/quotes`, `GET /api/quotes/{id}` all implemented. Proven end to end
against the real docs/DOMAIN.md worked example with a scripted `IChatClient`: process suspends at
approval with the spindle tape unresolved, approving resumes to a real `QTN-` quote, and the trace
replays after the stream closes. A stubbed 429 proves `provider_rate_limited`. 156/156 tests pass
(117 unit + 39 integration), 0 warnings under `-warnaserror`, `npm run build` clean.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Api/Streaming/AgentEventStreamWriter.cs` (the one place SSE
framing exists), `src/QuoteDesk.Api/Approvals/` and `Quotes/` (new), `src/QuoteDesk.Data/Migrations/
…AddAgentRunTrace`, `tests/QuoteDesk.IntegrationTests/Api/AgentStreamEndpointTests.cs`.

**Decisions made:** Three scope questions settled with Harsh before coding — rate limiting deferred to
task 09 (defends a URL that doesn't exist yet), the trace stored as one `AgentRuns.TraceJson` column
appended by read-merge-rewrite, and approvals support only approve/reject (`edit` returns 400 until
task 08 defines that payload). Full detail and reasoning in tasks/task-07-api.md's Notes on completion.

**Known gaps:** No pipeline stage emits a `token` SSE event — Price's narration runs non-streaming
(docs/SPEC.md §8 records this as a real task-06 gap, not fixed here; bigger than task 07's scope).
Separately, `QuoteWriteTools.CreateQuoteDraftAsync` still hardcodes `ShipTo`/`RequiredBy` to null even
though `ApprovalRequest` has carried real values since task 06 — found, not touched.

**Live-Gemini finding, significant:** Harsh supplied a real key mid-session; the first-ever live run
of the real pipeline (`tests/QuoteDesk.Evals/GeminiWorkedExampleEval.cs`, dev DB migrated to catch up
first — it was 2 migrations behind) surfaced that the `thought_signature` protocol gap docs/SPEC.md
already documented for *streaming* also breaks the **non-streaming** path: Extract succeeds,
`resolve_customer` executes and returns a real result, and the very next turn — submitting that result
back to the model — fails with the same `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT thought_signature` error. Task 00's
spike verified non-streaming against one hand-rolled round trip, not the real `ChatClientAgent` /
`FunctionInvokingChatClient` loop `ResolveExecutor` runs. **The whole Resolve stage cannot currently
complete against real `gemini-3.6-flash`.** docs/SPEC.md §4 now records this correction in full; the
eval fails on purpose as its regression test. A smaller, already-fixed finding from the same run: the
model didn't reliably format `requiredBy` as ISO-8601 (`"5th"` on one run, valid on another) — fixed
via a lenient converter plus a tighter prompt instruction, both in this commit.

**Blocked on Harsh:** The `thought_signature` finding above needs a direction decision, not a guess —
options include checking whether a newer `Microsoft.Agents.AI`/`Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI`
release has addressed it, switching the default profile to `github` (SPEC.md §4: real OpenAI models,
correct tool-calling, but ~50 req/day and an ~8K input cap — cannot carry the demo), or something else
entirely. This blocks the Resolve stage working end to end against the pinned model, which blocks a
real browser demo — everything else in tasks 06–07 is proven correct against a stub and does not
depend on this being resolved.

**Next:** Resolve the `thought_signature` non-streaming finding above before task 08, or explicitly
decide to proceed with task 08 (React screens) anyway, since the UI can be built and demoed against
stub-driven or replayed runs regardless. `src/QuoteDesk.Web/src/api/agentEvents.ts` is ready for
`useAgentStream` to consume either way.

## 2026-08-30 — Gemini `thought_signature` fix: adopted Google.GenAI

**Done:** The `thought_signature` blocker above is resolved. Harsh asked whether OpenRouter or
Google's native SDK would fix it; researched both — OpenRouter confirmed no fix (same OpenAI-compat
shim, same error, per multiple independent GitHub issue reports), Google's official `Google.GenAI`
.NET SDK confirmed a real fix (`api-researcher`: read the SDK's own source and decompiled this
project's exact installed `FunctionInvokingChatClient` — the adapter round-trips the signature through
a standard `TextReasoningContent.ProtectedData` field, which the loop never strips). Spiked first
(isolated `resolve_customer` call, no pipeline involved) — passed. Adopted for real:
`ChatClientFactory.Create` now branches on a new `LlmOptions.Provider` (`"gemini"` → `Google.GenAI`,
`"github"` → unchanged `OpenAIClient`). Confirmed live through the actual `EnquiryPipeline`: Extract
succeeded, `resolve_customer` **and** `get_customer_history` both completed multi-turn with real tool
results — the exact call that failed before now works — before a genuine free-tier daily quota (20
requests/day for `gemini-3.6-flash` on this key) cut the run short. 157/157 non-eval tests still pass.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Llm/ChatClientFactory.cs` (the branch + full reasoning),
`src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Llm/LlmOptions.cs` (`Provider`), `docs/SPEC.md` §4 (full resolution write-up).

**Decisions made:** Spike-then-adopt, not straight to production code — Harsh's call, to avoid
touching `ChatClientFactory` before knowing it would work. Trade-off accepted knowingly: `Google.GenAI`
takes an API key, not a base URL, so the `gemini` profile lost the "any OpenAI-compatible endpoint"
swappability; `github` is unaffected. Found and fixed in the same pass: the two profiles now throw
different exception types for a rate limit (`ClientResultException` vs `Google.GenAI.ClientError`) —
the live quota hit proved this was a real gap, not hypothetical, so `EnquiryPipeline.ToErrorEvent` now
matches both, with a new stub-based regression test.

**Known gaps:** No single completely clean live run (Extract → Resolve → Price → `ApprovalRequiredEvent`)
has completed yet — the free-tier quota (20 req/day for this model) was exhausted mid-verification.
The multi-turn tool-calling mechanism itself is confirmed fixed (two real tool calls completed that
previously failed on the very first one); what's unconfirmed is only the *rest* of the pipeline
(Price's narration call, the full worked example's ambiguity handling) under the new client, which
should behave identically since nothing else changed, but hasn't been watched happen end to end yet.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing required, but worth knowing: 20 requests/day is tight for a live public
demo one Google account away from being useless — worth checking Google AI Studio for a way to raise
this free-tier quota, or confirming this is expected for `gemini-3.6-flash` specifically, before task 09.

**Next:** Once the daily quota resets, run `dotnet test tests/QuoteDesk.Evals --filter GeminiWorkedExampleEval`
once more to confirm a fully clean pass, then proceed to task 08 (React screens) — nothing about the
UI depends on this being re-verified first.

## 2026-08-30 — Phase 0 result: gemini-3.1-flash-lite tested, rejected for quality

**Done:** Ran the real worked example against `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (a separate free-tier quota
bucket from `gemini-3.6-flash`'s exhausted 20/day). Quota was not the limiting factor this time — the
run consumed far more than 20 requests with no quota error at all, confirming per-model buckets are
real and separate. But it failed on quality: `search_catalog("6203 bearing")` came back with **112
weakly-scored candidates** (all confidence 0.2, matched only on the token "RING") instead of narrowing
to the actual bearing, and the model then tried to disambiguate by calling `get_customer_history`
one SKU at a time across many candidates — a brute-force exploration that burned 153,724 tokens against
a 20,000 budget before `EnquiryPipeline`'s safety cap correctly stopped the run with `budget_exceeded`.
Nothing wrong reached anywhere (the safety net worked exactly as designed), but the judgment quality
was measurably worse than `gemini-3.6-flash`'s clean run on the identical enquiry.

**Decision: stay on `gemini-3.6-flash`.** Per the plan agreed before this test: a demo that reasons
this poorly is worse than one that occasionally runs out of quota. `tests/QuoteDesk.Evals/GeminiFlashLiteWorkedExampleEval.cs`
kept in the repo as a real, dated record of this — not deleted — so a future session doesn't re-attempt
the same switch without re-testing (and re-test is worth doing again later: this was one run, on a
"Lite" model that may simply need a different, less open-ended prompt to search well, not necessarily
a permanent verdict on the model itself).

**Next:** Proceed to batching `search_catalog` (already approved, model-independent) — see the current
plan for the concrete change.

## 2026-08-30 — Batched search_catalog

**Done:** `search_catalog` now resolves every line item in one call instead of one call per line —
`(CatalogSearchQuery[] queries) -> CatalogSearchResult[]`, one result per query in the same order.
For docs/DOMAIN.md's worked example this cuts Resolve from 6 real model calls to 4, and the whole
pipeline from 8 to 6. No change was needed to `ResolveExecutor`, `TracedAIFunction`, or
`ToolCallBudget` — none of them ever assumed one call resolved one line. 158/158 non-eval tests pass
(118 unit + 40 integration — one new unit test added for the batch case), `npm run build` clean.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Tools/CatalogTools.cs`,
`src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Tools/Results/CatalogResults.cs` (new `CatalogSearchQuery`, `CatalogSearchResult`
gained a `Query` echo field), `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Prompts/resolve.md`, docs/SPEC.md §7.

**Decisions made:** Kept the tool name and read/write registry unchanged — only its signature changed,
so `ToolRegistryTests`'s fixed name list needed no update. `CatalogSearchResult` gained a `Query` field
(echoing which input it answers) so the model — and a human reading the trace panel — can map a
batched call's results back to specific line items without relying on array position alone.

**Known gaps:** None new. This closes out the batching work from the earlier assessment; the narration
LLM-call-removal option from that same assessment was not picked and remains undone, on purpose.

**Next:** Task 08 — React screens. Nothing about this session's work changes that scope.

## 2026-08-30 — gemini-3.5-flash-lite tested, also rejected for quality

**Done:** Harsh checked Google AI Studio's own rate-limit dashboard directly — real numbers, not blog
guesses: `gemini-3.6-flash`/`gemini-3.7-flash`/`gemini-3 Flash` all cap at 20/day (matches what we
already measured), but `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` shows 500/day. Worth testing on quota grounds alone.
Ran the same rigorous worked-example eval used for `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. Result: same class of
failure, different mechanism — the batched `search_catalog` call itself (confirms batching works
correctly against a real model) came back with a wildly over-broad candidate list (342 SKU mentions
across the three line items, in a ~300-item catalogue), and the model burned 56,463 tokens against the
20,000 budget trying to work through it before the safety cap stopped the run.

**Now two different "Lite" models have failed this exact bar, for related but distinct reasons** —
`3.1-flash-lite` over-explored via many small `get_customer_history` calls, `3.5-flash-lite` got a
bloated result from one `search_catalog` call. Both point at the same underlying weakness: Lite-tier
models construct less specific/tighter search queries than `gemini-3.6-flash` does, which this
project's `CatalogTools` scoring is sensitive to. This is real, repeated signal, not a fluke — staying
on `gemini-3.6-flash` as primary is the right call until/unless a Lite model gets a properly tuned
prompt for this specific task (not attempted; out of scope right now).

**Files that matter:** `tests/QuoteDesk.Evals/Gemini35FlashLiteWorkedExampleEval.cs` (new, kept as a
dated record, same reasoning as the 3.1 variant).

**Next:** Harsh asked about a fallback chain (gemini-3.6-flash primary, drop to a Lite model only once
quota is truly exhausted) rather than switching the primary outright. Given both Lite candidates now
have confirmed quality problems, this reframes as "worse but available beats nothing," not "just as
good and free" — a real design worth doing carefully, not a quick win. Not started; needs its own scoping
(mid-conversation model switching risk, whether to fall back per-run vs mid-run, how the trace panel
shows which model actually answered).

## 2026-08-30 — Session close: root cause refined, task 08 is next

**Done:** Traced the `3.5-flash-lite` failure down to real data rather than guessing: the model's
`search_catalog` query was reasonable ("PU timing belt", hint "25mm"); the 150-candidate flood was
`CatalogTools.Score` matching every "Rubber Timing Belt" too, because it counts overlapping words
without weighting the one that actually distinguishes the item (PU vs Rubber). **Corrects the earlier
entry's framing** ("Lite models construct less specific queries") — the confirmed root cause is our
own scoring code being too permissive, not the model's query construction. Separately, real: once
handed a big/ambiguous list, `3.1-flash-lite` chose to brute-force it (many individual
`get_customer_history` calls) instead of accepting ambiguity like the prompt instructs — that part is
a genuine model-quality difference, not a code bug.

**Decision:** Task 08 (React screens) starts next session, before any of today's follow-ups
(`CatalogTools.Score` reweighting, a model-fallback chain). Both are real and worth doing, but
deliberately parked — UI comes first.

**Known gaps / parked for later:** `CatalogTools.Score` doesn't weight distinguishing words — worth
fixing regardless of which model is used, and might be enough on its own to make a Lite model viable.
A model-fallback chain (gemini-3.6-flash primary, Lite as last resort once quota's gone) discussed but
not designed — needs its own scoping session.

**Everything from today (task 07, the Google.GenAI/thought_signature fix, batched `search_catalog`,
three eval files) is staged but not committed** — nothing lost, ready whenever Harsh wants the commit
message.

**Next:** Task 08 — React screens (Desk, Approvals, Quotes), starting fresh next session.

## 2026-08-31 — Task 08: React screens

**Done:** The three screens exist and build. Desk: paste an enquiry, it POSTs to `/api/enquiries`
then streams `/process` into a live Agent Trace panel; on the approval gate an `ApprovalCard`
renders below and Approve/Reject streams `/approvals/{id}`. Approvals: lists pending cards, decide
in place. Quotes: list + detail, detail replays the stored trace beside the quote. `provider_rate_limited`
swaps the trace for a replay picker backed by three hand-written `AgentEvent[]` fixtures — works with
the API stopped. Hash routing (`#/desk/:id`, `#/quotes/:id`) survives refresh. `tsc -b`, `npm run lint`
(oxlint), `npm run build` all clean; `dotnet build -warnaserror` clean; 118 unit tests pass.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Web/src/hooks/useAgentStream.ts` (the only SSE reader — fetch +
ReadableStream), `src/components/TracePanel.tsx` and `ApprovalCard.tsx` (the two bespoke pieces),
`src/api/types.ts` (TS mirrors of the C# records), `src/api/traceLabels.ts` (tool-name → human label).

**Decisions made:** Designed the 7 artboards in Claude Design first, then transcribed — canvas at
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/e9d0ad5e-3227-4514-b1c9-e3347cae2231. No component library
(hand-rolled ~8 primitives in `components/ui.tsx`); shadcn considered, declined. Trace panel shows
plain-language labels, never raw tool names — Harsh's call, now in SPEC §8 + CLAUDE.md +
memory `ui-hides-internal-identifiers`. Approve/reject only, no ambiguous-line dropdown (needs
`UnresolvedLine.Candidates[]` server-side — deferred shape written into SPEC §8).

**Tests:** After Docker came up, the full non-eval suite passes — 118 unit + 40 integration
(`dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~Evals"`). Evals were deliberately not run to preserve the
Gemini free-tier daily quota.

**Known gaps:** No live end-to-end smoke test through the real pipeline yet — SSE parsing and the
post-refresh approval-id resolution (scans `GET /api/approvals`) are unverified against a running
API + Gemini; Harsh wants to drive the first full flow himself. Only a `429` triggers the replay
picker; `budget_exceeded` renders as a plain error. `provider_rate_limited` replay cards have
Approve/Reject disabled (no real `AgentRun` id). Pre-existing `only-export-components` oxlint warning
on `AuthContext.tsx` left as-is.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing. Start Docker Desktop next session so the full test suite and a live
demo run can happen.

**Next:** Task 09 — deploy (Docker, CI, live URL). First get a clean local end-to-end run with Docker
up to confirm task 08 works against the real API before deploying it.

## 2026-08-31 — Re-engineering the agent layer (retrieval, reliability, ceilings)

**Why:** Task 08's first real run failed. Root cause found by reading the stored trace: `search_catalog`
returned **342 candidates from a 262-row catalogue** — one tool result was 56 KB, 92% of the run's
record, re-sent on every turn of the tool loop until the provider gave up. The model's queries were
good; our retrieval was not.

**Two mechanisms, both confirmed against the real database.** We matched on letters, not whole words,
so "PU" also matched every "s**pu**r gear" (110 rows) and "ring" matched every "bea**ring**" (88 rows).
And nothing was ever capped — even a cleanly *resolved* query returned every near-miss.

**Done:**
- **Desk keeps its state.** A session provider sits above the router, so navigating to Approvals and
  back no longer destroys the enquiry, trace and error; it also survives a browser refresh via
  `sessionStorage` (400 KB cap, drops the trace before overflowing). Added **New enquiry**, **Retry**
  and **Edit & re-run**. Nothing clears except New enquiry or a successful approve. The Desk tab now
  links back to the run in progress.
- **Retrieval rewritten as two-stage.** Cheap substring shortlist, then a whole-word re-rank weighted
  by inverse document frequency, so rare distinguishing words (`PU`, `6203`, `2RS`, `25mm`) outweigh
  family words (`belt`, `bearing`). Scoring is additive, which fixes the bug where the junk hint word
  "as" (from "same as last time") dragged a perfect match below the resolve threshold. Absolute **and**
  relative confidence floors, hard cap of **5 candidates**. Candidate payload slimmed (dropped
  per-row reason, list price, uom). `get_customer_history` capped at 20 rows.
- **Output reliability.** New `StructuredModelCall`: provider-enforced JSON schema generated from the
  C# type (`Llm:UseStructuredOutput`, default true), falling back to the tolerant parser if the
  provider rejects it, plus **retry-once with the parse error fed back**. Schema mode is deliberately
  OFF for Resolve — it is the tool-calling stage and a strict response format applies to every turn of
  the loop. Few-shot examples added to `extract.md` and `resolve.md`, both showing the "I cannot tell"
  answer being used correctly.
- **Ceilings.** `BudgetedChatClient` counts tokens per model round-trip instead of after each stage,
  so the budget is a governor not a post-mortem — and it is now the *only* place tokens are counted.
  Defensive 8 KB cap on what a tool result writes into the trace.
- **Visibility.** All model calls go through logging middleware; the pipeline logs the full exception
  on failure and maps provider context-limit errors to `budget_exceeded` instead of a bare `internal`.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Tools/CatalogTools.cs` (the ranker),
`Pipeline/StructuredModelCall.cs`, `Pipeline/BudgetedChatClient.cs`,
`src/QuoteDesk.Web/src/desk/DeskSessionContext.tsx`.

**Verified:** 171 tests green (123 unit + 48 integration), up from 158. Against the **real seeded
database**: the worked example's three lines now come back `ambiguous` (6203 — needs the suffix),
`resolved` → `BELT-PU-25MM` (not the rubber belt), `ambiguous` (spindle tape thickness), with no
result exceeding 5 candidates. Six fully-specified seeded phrasings — including Hinglish
("6210 ZZ bearing ka rate bhejo") — resolve to the exact expected SKU. A new test proves a model reply
of prose instead of JSON is now retried rather than fatal.

**Decisions:** Chose two-stage retrieval + rarity ranking + schema exposure in the prompt, researched
against how Google AI Mode (query fan-out, rank, synthesise) and Elastic/Anthropic tool-design guidance
actually work. Deliberately NOT used: vector search (our discriminators are exact tokens like 6mm vs
8mm, which embeddings blur), Lucene (a search engine for 262 rows), SQL full-text (needs container and
Azure config plus raw SQL for the rank). Hand-rolled ~40 lines instead — the right call at this size,
and Harsh chose it explicitly on portfolio grounds. Self-querying structured filters were deferred
pending measurement; the ranker alone proved sufficient.

**Known gaps:** No live model run yet — whether `gemini-3.6-flash` honours schema-enforced output is
still unverified, and the first live run will log a warning and fall back if it does not. Response
caching and conversation trimming (`UseDistributedCache`, `UseChatReducer`) considered and skipped.
The project's own SPEC/DOMAIN/task docs are now out of step with the code and need a rewrite pass.

**Blocked on Harsh:** The one live end-to-end run — he asked to drive it himself and to keep the
Gemini free-tier daily allowance for it.

**Next:** Live run of the worked example through the UI. Then re-test `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (500/day
vs 20/day): the earlier "poor judgement" verdict is unsafe, because that model was judged while being
handed 342 candidates. If it now works, the quota problem disappears entirely.

## 2026-08-31 — Doc reconciliation + tasks 09–11 re-scope (no product code)

**Why:** the agent-layer rework left the project's own documents describing a system that no longer
exists, and tasks 09–11 predated it. Harsh will read the whole codebase against `docs/SPEC.md` in a
review pass after task 09, so SPEC has to be true first.

**Done — docs now match the code:**
- `docs/SPEC.md` §4 — "structured output deliberately not used" replaced with what is actually there
  (`StructuredModelCall`: schema mode for Extract/Narrate, tolerant-parser fallback, retry-once-with-
  the-error; Resolve stays plain-text). New `Llm:UseStructuredOutput` key. Per-stage model routing
  noted as task 09's.
- §7 — the two-stage `search_catalog` ranker written up (whole-word + IDF, additive scoring, 5-cap,
  slim `CatalogCandidate`), `get_customer_history` 20-row cap, the 8 KB trace cap.
- §8 — `BudgetedChatClient` (token budget is a governor now), `budget_exceeded` for provider
  context-limit errors, full-exception logging. Recorded that the frontend still only special-cases
  `429`.
- `docs/DOMAIN.md` — worked example step 3 corrected (6203 has four suffix variants, not two).
- `CLAUDE.md` — added the "Desk keeps its state" rule.
- `ChatClientFactory.cs` — one-line comment fix (cited a `GoogleGenAiSpike.cs` that never existed).
- Amendment blocks appended to `tasks/task-06/07/08` Notes on completion.

**Done — task files re-scoped:**
- **task 09** gains: model routing (Extract/Narrate on `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` 500/day, Resolve on
  `3.6-flash` 20/day) + per-run provider fallback, no user selector; sign-in screen polish; OAuth
  origin for the prod URL; the still-unbuilt rate limiter.
- **task 11** "Expanded" section: OpenTelemetry is entirely green-field; per-stage token/duration
  needs server-side emission; the eval "golden set" doesn't exist (3 files, same enquiry); no
  prompt-injection behavioural test; ADR-0002 reasoning is ready to write.
- **tasks/README.md** — added an "agent-layer rework (done)" row and a "code review + security
  review + codebase walkthrough" milestone between 09 and 10, where the audit's small correctness
  bugs (streaming-401 hole, deep-link-404 infinite load, swallowed Google `onError`) belong.

**Verified:** no stale phrases left in docs (`deliberately not used`, `GoogleGenAiSpike`, `matches
two SKUs` all gone); `dotnet build -warnaserror` clean; 171 tests green; `npm run build` clean.

**Blocked on Harsh:** still the one live end-to-end run (his to drive), which also settles whether
`gemini-3.6-flash` honours schema-enforced output.

**Next:** Task 09 — deploy. First a clean local live run of the worked example to confirm the
agent-layer rework works against the real API + model before it goes public.

**Git state at session end:** two commits on `development` — `f131fcc` (agent-layer rework) and
`b059337` (doc reconciliation). `development` fast-forward-merged into `main`; both branches now at
`b059337`. **Neither branch is pushed** — `origin/main` is at `3ba6b67`, `origin/development` at
`a7fb4f3`. Push is Harsh's to run. Build clean, 171 tests green, working tree clean.

## 2026-08-31 — First live run of the reworked pipeline (partial success)

**What ran:** two attempts against the real `gemini-3.6-flash`.

- **Enquiry #2004 (real):** Extract → Resolve (`resolve_customer`, `search_catalog`,
  `get_customer_history`, `check_stock`) → Price all **succeeded**. The 6th and final model call —
  Price's Narrate step — got `429`d: `GenerateRequestsPerMinutePerProjectPerModel-FreeTier`,
  `limit: 5`, "retry in 50s". Mapped correctly to `provider_rate_limited`; the replay panel showed,
  the enquiry text and trace were kept, navigating away and back preserved everything.
- **Enquiry #2005:** this was the **replayed fixture**, not a live run (Harsh clicked "Replay this
  run"). Reproduced the worked example faithfully — correct SKUs, the spindle-tape line unresolved,
  the belt date conflict, totals matching docs/DOMAIN.md. Approve/Reject correctly disabled (a
  replay has no `AgentRun` to POST to; the card says so).

**Confirmed working against the real model:**
- Schema-enforced JSON output on `gemini-3.6-flash` — Extract ran clean, no fallback warning.
- The two-stage retrieval fix — `search_catalog` did ~15 sub-millisecond `LIKE` queries then ranked
  in memory. No candidate flood. The pipeline sailed through Resolve.
- `get_customer_history` 20-row cap — visible in the SQL as `SELECT TOP(@p) … ORDER BY OrderedAt DESC`.
- `BudgetedChatClient`, the `provider_rate_limited` mapping, and the Desk state persistence.

**The blocker is the per-minute limit, not the daily one.** `gemini-3.6-flash` free tier is
**5 requests/minute**. One pipeline run makes ~6 sequential model calls (1 Extract + ~4 Resolve +
1 Narrate) in ~40 s, and they bunch. Extract alone took ~13 s on the first attempt (thinking-model
overhead), ~40 s total.

**"Replay this run" is a canned fixture, not a resume.** A failed run cannot be continued from where
it stopped — there is no checkpoint-resume for a mid-pipeline failure, only re-run from Extract.

**Next session — do these first, in order:**
1. **Model routing (~35 lines).** Try the simplest thing first: move **all three stages to
   `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`** (500/day, higher RPM, no thinking lag) and re-test. The earlier "poor
   judgement" verdict on the Lite models was reached while they were being handed 342 candidates —
   likely stale now. If Resolve holds on Lite, the quota/RPM problem is gone. If not, per-stage:
   Extract + Narrate on Lite, Resolve on `gemini-3.6-flash`. Shape: optional per-stage model
   overrides on `LlmOptions`, `ChatClientFactory` builds one client per distinct model, the pipeline
   picks per agent.
2. **Then the code review + security review + codebase walkthrough** — moved to **before task 09**
   (was: between 09 and 10). Rationale: understand the system before it goes public and before task
   10 adds channels; a security review belongs before the URL is live. The deploy-config half of the
   security review (Dockerfile, CI, secrets, CORS, public rate limiter) folds into task 09 itself.
   `tasks/README.md`'s milestone row needs moving to match.
3. Then task 09 (deploy), then task 10 (channels).

**Git:** unchanged from the entry above — `main` = `development` = `57e5842`, neither pushed.

## 2026-09-01 — Task 09a: deployable (model routing, rate limiting, container, CI)

**Done:** Extract/Narrate on `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, Resolve on `gemini-3.6-flash`
(`ChatClientRegistry` — two independent RPM buckets, the real fix for 08-31's run-ending 429). Rate
limiting live (`GlobalLimiter` on every route by default, `auth`/`pipeline` stacked stricter on the
two routes that need them). Sign-in screen rebuilt; a 5-sample enquiry picker replaced the bare
worked-example link, each verified against the live seeded DB. `Dockerfile` + compose `api` service —
built, runs as uid 1654, migrates+seeds+answers health checks, verified live. CI workflow written
(build Debug+Release → test → image). 177 tests green, `npm run build`/`lint` clean.

**Files that matter:** `ChatClientRegistry.cs`, `src/QuoteDesk.Api/RateLimiting/`, `Dockerfile`,
`tasks/task-09a-deployable.md`.

**Decisions made:** Task 09 split into 09a/09b. Deploy first, review after — reverses the prior
entry's plan, Harsh's explicit call. `/approvals/{id}` carries no rate-limit policy — `ApproveExecutor`
makes no model call. Compose's `api` binds host port 5080 (8080 is Vite's).

**Known gaps:** `dotnet build` (Debug) never triggers CA1848; only `dotnet publish -c Release` does,
and nothing had published Release before this task's Dockerfile — fixed (3 sites), and CLAUDE.md's
Commands now list Release too. `global.json` pins 10.0.400; the Docker base image floats on `10.0` —
accepted trade-off.

**Blocked on Harsh:** one live worked-example run through `docker compose up -d` (needs his Google
sign-in and his Gemini quota) and a pushed branch to confirm CI actually goes green.

**Update, same session:** Harsh created `.env` himself (my own Write to that path is hard-blocked at
two independent layers — a settings.json deny rule, and the auto-mode classifier refusing even to
edit that rule — both correctly held). With it in place, `docker compose up -d --build` was run for
real: `sql` healthy, `api` built and started, migrated, seeded, uid 1654, both health checks 200. The
compose path is now genuinely verified, not just `docker run` against the same network. Only the
Google-sign-in-gated run and the CI push remain, both still his.

**Harsh drove the first genuinely live run** — enquiry #3003 through the containerised API, real Google
sign-in, real Gemini calls. **52.68s total** (server-measured): Extract 1.69s, Resolve 49.59s (~13.7s
thinking before the first tool call, ~35.8s on the second turn), Narrate ~1.4s. No 429 — the
model-routing fix holds under a real run. Approve → quote: 330ms, no model call.

**Three real bugs found and fixed from that one run, all with tests, all live in the rebuilt
container:**
- Narration said "$58,179.90" — every number is ₹, but `narrate.md` never named a currency.
  One-line prompt fix.
- Approval card showed "0.03%" instead of "3%" — `QuoteDesk.Domain` represents discounts as a
  fraction (`MaxCombinedDiscountPct = 0.15m`), but `ApprovalCard.tsx`/`QuoteDetailScreen.tsx` both
  rendered the raw fraction with `%` appended. Invisible until now because the hand-written replay
  fixtures used the opposite convention (`discountPct: 7` meaning 7%), so the component looked
  correct against fixtures and wrong against the real backend the whole time. Added `percent()` to
  `lib/format.ts`, fixed both call sites, fixed the three fixtures to the real convention.
- Quotes list showed a correctly-resolved customer as "Unverified sender" — `Enquiries.CustomerId` is
  set `null` at intake (Paste never knows the customer) and **nothing in the codebase ever wrote
  Resolve's answer back onto it** — `IEnquiryRepository` had no update method at all. Fixed:
  `UpdateCustomerAsync`, called from `QuoteWriteTools.CreateQuoteDraftAsync` once a human approves,
  only filling in a `null`, never overwriting a known customer. New regression test uses a freshly
  created enquiry, not the seeded `ShreejiEnquiryId` — that already carries a customer and would hide
  this exact regression.

178 tests green (up from 177), Debug+Release build clean, `npm run build`/`lint` clean, container
rebuilt via `docker compose up -d --build` with the fixes and confirmed healthy.

**Next:** those two verifications, then task 09b (`az` CLI not installed yet — his first step), then
the code/security review, then task 10.

## 2026-09-01 (cont.) — Four more fixes from live testing, session cut short by context limit

**In progress — plan file at `C:\Users\Lazy Boy\.claude\plans\ohk-lets-start-task-typed-otter.md`
has the full design for all four; re-read it first.** Harsh drove more live runs after the three bug
fixes above and found four more things:

1. **Token usage always reported `{0,0}`** — root cause confirmed by reading the code: `DoneEvent`
   can only be built after `Approve` runs (a separate HTTP request from Extract/Resolve/Price), and
   each of `StartAsync`/`ResumeAsync` builds its own independent `TokenUsageTracker` — the one that
   saw real usage is garbage by the time the real `DoneEvent` fires from the zero-spend Approve leg.
   **DONE, backend-complete, build clean:** new migration `AddAgentRunTokenUsage` (`AgentRuns` gains
   `PromptTokens bigint NULL`, `CompletionTokens bigint NULL`); `AgentRunRecord`,
   `IAgentRunRepository.UpdateStatusAsync` (now takes `promptTokens`/`completionTokens`),
   `AgentRunRepository.ToRecord`, `TokenUsageTracker`'s constructor (optional seed params),
   `EnquiryPipeline.cs` (every `UpdateStatusAsync` call site passes the tracker's running total;
   `ResumeAsync` seeds its tracker from the persisted total instead of zero) — all edited. Test
   `ResumeAsync_Approved_ReportsCumulativeTokenUsageAcrossBothLegs` added to
   `EnquiryPipelineTests.cs`. **Not yet run** — `dotnet build` is clean but `dotnet test` was not
   executed before the session ended; run it first thing next session.

2. **A failed run couldn't resume past Resolve**, even though the framework checkpoints after every
   stage (confirmed live: the failed enquiry's one checkpoint sat unused right after Extract).
   **DONE, backend-complete, build clean:** `EnquiryPipeline.ProcessAsync` (new — what
   `EnquiryEndpoints.cs`'s `/process` now calls instead of `StartAsync` directly),
   `FindResumableFailedRunAsync` (eligible only when the last `StageEvent` before a `Failed` status
   is `"resolve"`), `ResumeFailedAsync` (reuses the *same* `AgentRun` row — resuming a checkpoint
   keeps its original `SessionId`, which has a unique index, so a new row is impossible). Two tests
   added: `ProcessAsync_WhenPriceFailedAfterResolveSucceeded_ResumesPastResolveInsteadOfRestarting`
   and `ProcessAsync_WhenResolveItselfFailed_StartsFreshRatherThanResuming`. **Not yet run** — same
   as above, build clean, tests not executed.

3. **Quotes list didn't show item names** — Harsh wanted "6210 ZZ bearing, 40mm cogged v belt, ..."
   visible, not just customer/total. **DONE.** `QuoteRepository.ListAsync` now `.Include(q => q.Lines)`
   (was missing entirely) plus one batched `CatalogItems` name lookup for every distinct SKU across
   the page (avoids N+1); `QuoteSummaryRecord`/`QuoteSummaryResponse`/TS `QuoteSummaryResponse` all
   gained `ItemNames`/`itemNames`; `QuotesScreen.tsx` has a new truncating "Items" column.
   `FakeQuoteRepository` (unit tests) updated to the new record shape too.

4. **Trace panel showed per-stage duration but no run total — DONE, both halves.** `agentEvents.ts`'s
   `done` variant gained `at?: string | null` (closes the C#/TS mismatch). `TracePanel.tsx`'s
   `buildTrace` now computes total run duration (first `StageEvent.at` → `DoneEvent.at`) and renders
   it on the same row as the token counts: `"done · 52.68s · N in · M out"`.

**All four fixes verified this pass:** a real bug was found and fixed along the way — the eligibility
check in fix 2 tested `lastStage == "resolve"`, but `ResolveExecutor` emits its `StageEvent` the
moment Resolve *starts*, not completes, so that check couldn't actually distinguish "Resolve failed"
from "Price failed after Resolve succeeded" (both show `"resolve"` last in the wrong case, or missed
the right one). Fixed to check for `"price"` instead — only reachable once Resolve has genuinely
finished. Also found: `EnquiryPipeline` itself never writes `AgentRuns.TraceJson` — only the API
layer's `AgentEventStreamWriter` does, after a real HTTP request — so the two new fix-2 tests (which
call the pipeline directly) have to persist the trace themselves via `AppendTraceAsync` between the
two `ProcessAsync` calls, exactly mimicking what production does. **181 tests green** (129 unit + 52
integration, up from 178), Debug+Release build clean, `npm run build`/`lint` clean.

**Also fixed:** the pre-existing quote `QTN-2026-0001` (enquiry #3003) was created before today's
`CustomerId` fix landed in the container, so it still showed "Unverified sender" — backfilled by hand
(`UPDATE Enquiries SET CustomerId = 6 WHERE Id = 3003`), not by any code change; the fix itself only
needed to be correct going forward.

**Docker Desktop needed a restart mid-session** — its containers and image cache were wiped
(`docker ps -a` came back completely empty, base image pulls then failed with `EOF` even though the
host itself could reach `mcr.microsoft.com` fine) — its internal WSL2 networking was in a bad state
after whatever caused the reset. Restarting the Docker Desktop process fixed it. If this recurs, that
is the fix — not a real infrastructure change.

**Blocked on Harsh:** nothing new. No live Gemini call was needed for any of today's four fixes — all
provable via the stub, and all now proven.

**Docs closed out, session ending here (Harsh's own weekly usage is nearly exhausted).**
`docs/SPEC.md` updated: §6's `AgentRuns` schema row and §8's `AgentEvent` union both now show
`PromptTokens`/`CompletionTokens`/`DoneEvent.At`, and a "Resolved 2026-09-01" block covers all four
fixes with the same detail as this log. `tasks/task-09a-deployable.md`'s "one live run" acceptance
criterion is now correctly checked off (Harsh did it, enquiry #3003) — only "CI green on a pushed
branch" remains open, and that needs an actual push.

**Task 10/11 order reversed, Harsh's call:** `tasks/README.md` now lists 11 (observability, evals,
README) before 10 (email/WhatsApp channels) — the eval suite and README are the actual portfolio
differentiators and don't need channels to exist first; channels are being saved for last on purpose.
Task numbers and file names are unchanged, only the execution order; neither task depends on the
other, so nothing about the swap is unsafe.

**Session ends here, deliberately, before starting new work.** Harsh will test today's four fixes
himself in the browser (the container is up and rebuilt with all of them), then push and merge
`development` into `main` himself, per the standing rule that commits and pushes are his to run.

**Next session, in order:** 1) confirm the push went through and CI is green (task 09a's last item);
2) task 11 (observability, evals, README) — the eval golden set doesn't exist yet beyond the worked
example, this is genuinely green-field work per the "Expanded 2026-08-31" section of
`tasks/task-11-observability-docs.md`; 3) task 09b (Azure) whenever Harsh wants the live URL — `az`
CLI still isn't installed on this machine; 4) task 10 (channels) last, as just decided.

**Git state:** nothing committed or pushed this session (per standing rule) — everything from today
(three bug fixes + four fixes + the 09a work before that) is staged on `development`, ready for Harsh
to review and push himself.

## 2026-09-01 (cont.) — Harsh tested live, found and fixed two more real gaps, then shipped

Harsh tested today's fixes in the browser himself and found two more real things: item names were
missing from the quote **detail** page (only the list had been fixed — `QuoteRepository.GetByIdAsync`
now does the same batched `CatalogItems` lookup `ListAsync` does, `QuoteLineRecord`/`QuoteLineResponse`
gained `ItemName`, shown above the SKU on the detail table); and the approval card's "Approve & send"
button is never disabled by unresolved lines — confirmed in code, not assumed, and traced to a real
semantic drift from `docs/DOMAIN.md`'s original worked example (which has the salesperson *resolve*
the ambiguity before approving) once task 08 deferred the resolve-inline UI. **Deliberately left
unfixed** — Harsh's call, "forget it for now" — worth revisiting: hard-disable vs. a distinct
"send partial quote" affordance are the two real options, written up for whenever he wants it.

**Six edge-case enquiries were designed and verified against the live database** for Harsh to try
(not_found item, real non-Local freight, a false "same as last time" claim with no supporting order
history, and a prompt-injection test) — none run yet, his to try next.

**Shipped.** All 181 tests green, Debug+Release build clean, `npm run build`/`lint` clean, one
commit (`10f7d1b`) on `development`, fast-forwarded into `main`, both pushed to `origin`. **CI ran on
the push and passed** — the first real confirmation `.github/workflows/ci.yml` actually works, not
just that it's well-formed YAML.

**Task 09a is now fully done** except nothing else — the "CI green on a push" acceptance criterion is
satisfied. `docs/SPEC.md`, `tasks/README.md` (11 before 10) and `tasks/task-09a-deployable.md` are all
reconciled with the final state.

**Next session:** a new task, starting fresh. In order per the reordering above: task 11
(observability, evals, README — green-field), then task 09b (Azure, `az` CLI needs installing first),
then task 10 (channels) last. The two left-open items (detail-page item names — done — and the
approve-button/unresolved-lines question — deliberately deferred) are the only loose threads; neither
blocks anything.

## 2026-09-02 — Task 09b planning only (session cut short, nothing built)

**Nothing was created, changed or staged this session.** Working tree is clean at `38a4708` on
`development`. This entry exists so the next session can resume planning without re-deriving anything.

**Where we got to:** task 09b (deploy to Azure) was explored and four decisions were taken with Harsh
before the session was stopped. No Azure resource exists, no CD workflow was written, no file was
touched.

**Harsh's four decisions (settled — do not re-ask):**

1. **Azure account:** he already has a subscription; `az login` is available to him.
2. **Registry: GHCR, public package** (`ghcr.io/harsh2292/quotedesk-api`), pushed from the CD workflow
   with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Chosen over ACR Basic specifically because ACR is the only
   line item in this whole deploy that isn't free (~$5/month). Container Apps pulls a *public* GHCR
   image with **no registry credentials at all**, so it also removes a secret.
3. **Region: Central India** — lowest latency from Surat. To be verified at execution time that the
   SQL free offer and Container Apps both exist there; Southeast Asia is the agreed fallback.
4. **Cold start: accept it, be honest, and warm early.** Measure the real number, write it into
   `SignInScreen.tsx`'s placeholder copy (currently the words "a few seconds", lines 67-70), *and*
   have the sign-in screen fire a fire-and-forget `/health/ready` on mount so Azure SQL starts
   resuming while the visitor reads the card and clicks Google. A keep-warm cron ping was considered
   and **rejected with a reason**: keeping SQL awake burns the 100,000 vCore-second monthly grant in
   roughly two days, after which the database auto-pauses for the rest of the month and the demo is
   dead.

**HARD CONSTRAINT, stated by Harsh mid-session and overriding the task file where they conflict:**
**₹0. He must not be charged, even though a credit card is attached, and his 12-month Azure free-account
period is already over.** Everything below was verified against Microsoft's own docs against exactly
that constraint:

| Piece | Free? | The guard that makes it ₹0 |
|---|---|---|
| Azure SQL | **Free forever, not a trial perk** — 100,000 vCore-seconds + 32 GB data + 32 GB backup per database per month, reset on the 1st, up to 10 databases per subscription, no time limit | Create with `--use-free-limit --free-limit-exhaustion-behavior AutoPause`. On exhaustion the database simply becomes inaccessible until the next calendar month at **no charge**. The irreversible choice is opting *into* billing ("Continue using database with additional charges"), which we never do — and once taken it cannot be reverted. |
| Container Apps | 180,000 vCPU-seconds + 360,000 GiB-seconds + 2,000,000 requests per subscription per month, always-free, Consumption plan | Consumption-only environment; `min-replicas 0` so an idle app costs literally nothing; `max-replicas 1` so a traffic spike cannot scale into charges. |
| Static Web Apps | Free SKU, no expiry | Do not pick Standard. |
| **Log Analytics** | 5 GB/month ingestion free | **The one real leak.** A Container Apps environment provisions a Log Analytics workspace by default and it bills past 5 GB. Cap it with a daily quota (or `--logs-destination none`, at the cost of losing live logs) so it physically cannot exceed the grant. |

The ended free-trial period does not affect any of the above — these are always-free recurring monthly
grants, not 12-month new-account offers.

**Also established by exploration (saves re-doing it):**

- **`az` CLI is still not installed.** An attempt to install it via
  `winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI` was started and cancelled when the session was stopped.
  This is the first blocker next session.
- **No infra assets exist anywhere in the repo** — no `staticwebapp.config.json`, no bicep/ARM, no
  `infra/`, no CD workflow. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the only workflow and its `image` job builds
  but never pushes.
- The container listens on **8080** via `ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080`, runs as `USER app`
  (uid 1654), and never calls `UseHttpsRedirection` — correct for Container Apps ingress terminating
  TLS.
- `Program.cs` **fails fast** on an empty `Auth:Google:ClientId`, a `Auth:Jwt:SigningKey` under 32
  bytes, and an empty `Llm:ApiKey`. Note `GetConnectionString("QuoteDesk")` returns `""` rather than
  null for the appsettings default, so a missing connection string does **not** trip its throw — it
  fails later at SQL connect.
- **`SeedOnStartup` is nested inside `MigrateOnStartup`** in `Program.cs` — setting
  `Database__SeedOnStartup=true` alone does nothing; both must be true.
- **`/health/live` runs no checks** (`Predicate = _ => false`) and `/health/ready` runs the SQL check.
  Both anonymous, both exempt from the rate limiter. The Container App liveness probe must use
  `/health/live` only, exactly as the task file says.
- **A real startup risk to design for:** migration runs *before* `app.Run()`, so the container is not
  listening until `MigrateAsync()` finishes. On a cold start against an auto-paused Azure SQL that
  wait includes the database resume. The startup probe needs a generous
  `failureThreshold × periodSeconds` (~300s) or Container Apps will kill the replica while it is
  legitimately waiting. `EnableRetryOnFailure()` is already on the EF Core provider.
- **A circular ordering dependency between the two hosts:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL` needs the Container
  App FQDN, and `Auth__AllowedOrigins__0` needs the Static Web Apps URL. Resolve by creating the
  Container App first, then the SWA, then updating the Container App's `AllowedOrigins`.
- SWA needs a `staticwebapp.config.json` with a `navigationFallback` rewrite to `/index.html`, or
  every deep link (`/approvals`, `/quotes`) 404s.
- CORS is already built (task 07) and is inert until `Auth:AllowedOrigins` is non-empty.
  `AgentEventStreamWriter` already sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, which is why the task file insists on
  direct cross-origin calls to the Container App rather than an SWA proxy route.

**Next session, in order:** 1) install `az` and `az login` (Harsh's, or retry the winget install);
2) verify Central India hosts both the SQL free offer and Container Apps; 3) provision in the order
Container App → SWA → back-fill `AllowedOrigins`; 4) write `staticwebapp.config.json` and the CD
workflow; 5) Harsh adds the SWA origin to the Google OAuth client's authorized JavaScript origins
(portal click, his); 6) budget alert; 7) measure cold start and write the number into both
`SignInScreen.tsx` and this log.

**Session stopped by Harsh mid-turn (frozen screen, machine restart needed). Nothing left in a
half-finished state — there was nothing to finish.**

---

## 2026-09-13 — foundry-00: forked into a new repo for the Agent-a-Thon

**Done:** This repo now exists as an independent fork of `Harsh2292/Quote-Desk@development` (`fb45bdb`),
for the Microsoft Agent-a-Thon (Level 3). `.git` history removed and not yet re-initialised.
`.gitignore`, both `UserSecretsId`s, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `tasks/README.md`, and
`docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` are updated for this fork. `docs/AGENT-A-THON.md` (event research, partly
superseded — see its own banner) and `.env.local` were copied over by hand.

**Files that matter:** `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` (the live plan — read this first, every session),
`tasks/README.md` (the active `foundry-NN` queue plus the inherited history), `CLAUDE.md`'s new
architecture line (two agents: Intake, Resolve).

**Decisions made:** Two agents split by cognitive role (Intake perceives, Resolve decides) — not the
earlier Customer/Catalogue split, which broke "same as last time" disambiguation. `.claude/` is
tracked in this fork (a deliberate deviation from the original plan) so a fresh clone keeps the
skills and settings this workflow depends on. Full reasoning for every decision: `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md`.

**Known gaps:** No `.git` exists yet (task foundry-01). No user-secrets set — build/test have not run
in this repo yet. No Foundry resource exists yet (Step 0, Harsh's). Module 6 (orchestration) and
module 4 (monitoring) course summaries not yet supplied — see the plan's Compliance audit.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Step 0 (create the Foundry resource, three model deployments, connect App
Insights, `curl` for quota, `az login`, `gh auth login`) — nothing after `foundry-01` can run live
until this is done. Also: choose the new database name/connection string, and confirm the Founderz
upload form's anonymity rule before `foundry-08`.

**Next:** `foundry-01` — `gh auth login`, create the GitHub repo, first commit and push.

---

## 2026-09-13 (cont.) — Step 0 mostly done; git initialized locally; deployment names decided

**Done:** `git init -b main` + `git switch -c development` in this repo (still local — nothing
committed or pushed; that's Harsh's, whenever he's ready, no deadline pressure before the 17th).
All 292 files staged and verified clean (no secret files). Foundry resource confirmed to already
exist (`pharshin29-2918-resource` / project `pharshin29-2918`, `quotedesk-rg`, `westus3`). The
Foundry API key is stored via `dotnet user-secrets` on `src/QuoteDesk.Api` (shared with
`QuoteDesk.Evals` via the same `UserSecretsId`) — not in any file. The correct resource endpoint
(`.../services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1/`, not the project endpoint) was found and live-tested: a real
`gpt-4o-mini` completion came back with zero deployment needed (Foundry's "instant access"). Full
detail in `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md`'s Step 0, now rewritten to be current rather than a todo list.

**Decisions made:** Harsh deploys everything in the Foundry portal himself — this is explicitly how
he wants to learn Foundry hands-on, even for steps Claude could technically automate via `az`
(confirmed working and authenticated on this machine). Two deployments only, not three:
**`gpt-5-nano`** for Intake, **`gpt-5-mini`** for Resolve, both Standard/pay-per-token at the lowest
TPM setting. No separate judge deployment — each target model judges the other's traces, which
satisfies module 5's "judge differs from the target" rule per evaluation run without a third paid
deployment. `gpt-4o-mini` was tried for a new deployment and rejected by Azure (retired for new
deployments in this catalog) — confirms the GPT-5-nano/mini pair is the real choice, not a fallback.

**Known gaps:** The two deployments above are decided but **not yet created** — Harsh is doing this
next, in the portal. Application Insights not connected. Roles not granted. Budget alert not set.
None of `foundry-02` onward can run live until the two deployments exist.

**A real incident, worth recording as-is:** the Foundry API key was pasted in plaintext into a chat
message while getting it into user-secrets. It was stored immediately and never echoed back or
re-used in visible text, but it should still be **regenerated in the portal** as routine hygiene —
a secret that appeared in a chat transcript is exposed regardless of what happens to it afterward.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Create the two deployments above; connect Application Insights; grant the two
roles (Foundry User for himself, Log Analytics Reader for the project's managed identity); regenerate
the API key; set the budget alert; `gh auth login`, then push whenever convenient (no rush before
the 17th, but commit locally now regardless of push timing).

**Next:** **Start the next session rooted in this folder (`E:\DevStuff\quotedesk-foundry`), not the
old project's.** This session has been operating from the old project's directory the whole time,
which means it's still reading the *old* `CLAUDE.md` as its always-loaded instructions, not this
fork's corrected one — a fresh session opened here will load the right rules and index the right
codebase automatically. Once the two deployments exist and their exact names are confirmed, start
`foundry-01` (repo/push, if not already done) then `foundry-02` (the real provider switch).

---

## 2026-09-14 — foundry-01 done; local run proven; a real Foundry finding

**Done:** The app runs locally end-to-end (SQL container, API, Vite) and the full worked example
(Shreeji Textiles) completed through approval to a sent quote, verified in the database, on the
Gemini provider — proving the pipeline itself is healthy before touching Foundry. `foundry-01`
finished: public repo `Harsh2292/quotedesk-foundry` exists, `development` is the default branch, both
branches' first CI run is green, repo indexed in codebase-memory. **Live-verified finding that unblocks
foundry-02:** Foundry's "instant access" preview serves `gpt-5-mini`/`gpt-5-nano` by name with **zero
deployment**, in `westus3` (matches the resource's region) — a real `chat/completions` call to each
returned `HTTP 200` with no deployment ever created. Step 0's "create two deployments" task is moot.

**Files that matter:** `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` Step 0 (the instant-access finding, in full) and
`tasks/task-foundry-02-provider.md` (updated to use model names directly, no deployment dependency).

**Decisions made:** `docker-compose.yml`'s container names changed to `quotedesk-foundry-sql`/`-api`
(collided with a leftover container from the original project). `.github/workflows/cd.yml` deleted —
it hardcoded the *original* deployed project's exact Azure resource names and GHCR path, which this
fork's cut app-deployment scope doesn't need and which risked touching that live deployment if ever
wired to real secrets. `HEAD` was repointed from an unborn `development` to `main` before the first
commit, so the import lands on `main` first, matching the intended workflow.

**Known gaps:** `Llm:Provider` is still `"gemini"` in `appsettings.json` (local user-secrets currently
hold a real Gemini key, not the Foundry key, purely to prove the pipeline live tonight) —
`foundry-02` replaces this properly. `src/QuoteDesk.Web/.env.development.local` (gitignored, holds
the real `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`) exists only on this machine.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing — the deployment blocker is resolved. Local commit is still pending:
`docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md`, `tasks/README.md`, and the two task files above are staged but uncommitted.

**Next:** `foundry-02` — swap `ChatClientFactory`/`LlmOptions`/`appsettings.json` to the `"foundry"`
provider, `gpt-5-nano`/`gpt-5-mini` by name, and run `FoundryWorkedExampleEval` live.

---

## 2026-09-15 — foundry-02 done: Foundry is the live provider

**Done:** The pipeline now runs on Microsoft Foundry by default. `ChatClientFactory` gained a
`"foundry"` branch (reuses the existing OpenAI-compatible path `"github"` already used — no new code,
confirming the endpoint really does speak the same wire protocol). `appsettings.json` points at the
resource's `/openai/v1/` URL with `IntakeModel`/`NarrateModel: gpt-5-nano`, `ResolveModel: gpt-5-mini`,
`TokenBudget` 60000, `MaxToolCalls` 10. `LlmOptions.ExtractModel` → `IntakeModel` (property rename
only — `ExtractExecutor`/`"Extract"` stage name are untouched, that's foundry-03).
`FoundryWorkedExampleEval` passed live: 42s, real multi-turn tool calls via
`FunctionInvokingChatClient` against `gpt-5-mini`, `resolve_customer` fired, reached one
`ApprovalRequiredEvent`, no `ErrorEvent`. No schema-rejection warning, so `UseStructuredOutput` stays
`true`. Both build configs clean, 129 unit + 52 integration tests green.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Llm/ChatClientFactory.cs`,
`src/QuoteDesk.Api/appsettings.json`, `tests/QuoteDesk.Evals/FoundryWorkedExampleEval.cs`, and
`tasks/task-foundry-02-provider.md`'s Notes on completion (the full write-up).

**Decisions made:** `LlmOptions.Provider`'s C# class **default** stays `"gemini"`, not `"foundry"` —
the three Gemini eval files build `LlmOptions` without setting `Provider`, relying on that default to
route through `Google.GenAI`'s native SDK; changing it would silently reintroduce the
`thought_signature` bug there. `"foundry"` is the real default only via `appsettings.json`.

**Known gaps:** foundry-03 (Intake Agent rename + `verify_catalogue_term` tool) not started.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing to answer before the next session. One thing worth doing when
convenient: the local `Llm:ApiKey` in user-secrets was found stale (53-char `AQ.`-prefixed value,
didn't match the resource's actual 84-char live key — HTTP 401 on a raw `curl` proved it, unrelated to
any code). Fixed by re-pulling the current key via `az cognitiveservices account keys list` and
updating user-secrets directly (not a portal action, so didn't need to wait for Harsh). Worth tracking
down *why* the stored value went stale, and this is also a good moment for the routine key-regenerate
hygiene `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` Step 0 already flagged.

**Next:** `foundry-03` — rename `ExtractExecutor` → `IntakeExecutor`, add the `verify_catalogue_term`
tool, update the stage union and prompts.

---

## 2026-09-15 — Latency investigated and root-caused; Extract/Narrate sped up, Resolve deliberately untouched

**Done:** Measured real per-stage/tool timing (a throwaway instrumented run, not committed) and found
the ~48s pipeline is 99.98% model latency — the three Resolve tool calls together cost 109ms; DB reads
were never the bottleneck. Root-caused *why* with hard evidence (a raw request against the real Extract
prompt): 320 of 473 completion tokens were invisible reasoning tokens, not the visible answer. Verified
`ReasoningEffort.None` (a real `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.ChatOptions.Reasoning` property, not
experimental) drops reasoning tokens to 0 with the output byte-for-byte unchanged. Wired it into Extract
and Narrate only (27%/64% faster respectively); confirmed live afterward that both judgement calls still
land correctly (bearing resolves via history at 8%, spindle tape stays unresolved with its reason).
Both builds clean, 181 tests green. Change is staged, not committed.

**Files that matter:** `EnquiryPipeline.cs`'s `BuildNodes` (Extract/Narrate now built via
`ChatClientAgentOptions { ChatOptions.Reasoning = ReasoningEffort.None }` instead of the plain
`AsAIAgent(instructions:, ...)` overload — Resolve is untouched).

**Decisions made:** Resolve deliberately kept on default reasoning — it is the one stage with a genuine
judgment call, and Harsh's explicit standing rule (saved to memory, `quality-over-speed.md`) is that
precision always outranks latency, never the reverse. Multi-tenant/concurrent-client handling was
explicitly declined as out of scope (`docs/SPEC.md` §9's Multi-tenancy non-goal). Found a real,
still-open design gap for `foundry-04`: `docs/SPEC.md`'s `IncomingEnquiry.Attachments[]` is plural, but
`FOUNDRY-PLAN.md`'s actual plan (`Enquiries.ImageDataUrl`, one nullable column) only supports one image
— fix to a real array/child table when `foundry-04` is built, not a queue.

**Known gaps:** Resolve's reasoning effort is unverified — it needs testing across **multiple** runs
(its own tool-calling behavior is non-deterministic: one run called `check_stock` three times, another
zero times) before deciding whether `None`/`Low` is safe there too. `ChatOptions.AllowMultipleToolCalls`
(letting `resolve_customer`+`search_catalog` fire in one turn, since neither depends on the other) is
identified as a lever but not yet tried.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Nothing.

**Next:** `foundry-03` (Intake Agent rename + `verify_catalogue_term` tool). While touching Resolve's
prompt/tools there, also test `ReasoningEffort.None`/`Low` against Resolve specifically, across several
runs, before applying it — same bar as above.

## 2026-09-17 — Review fixes (committed 7e9be87) + foundry-03: Intake Agent

**Done:** A code review of the foundry-01/02 work found two real bugs, both fixed and committed in `7e9be87`. First, the reasoning-off setting had only been tested on `gpt-5-mini` while production sends it to `gpt-5-nano`. Checked live: nano accepts `reasoning_effort: none`. It is now the config value `Llm:LightStageReasoningEffort`, set only for the foundry profile. Second, the Gemini evals were reading the Foundry key and would have sent it to Google; they now read `Llm:GeminiApiKey`. Then foundry-03: the first stage is now the **Intake agent**, which reads the enquiry and may call `verify_catalogue_term`. Resolve is unchanged. One tool-call budget per run is shared by both agents. Live Foundry eval passes in 28s: intake → resolve → price, 6203 resolved, spindle tape unresolved. 140 unit + 54 integration tests green; both builds clean. foundry-03 is staged, **not committed**.

**Files that matter:** `EnquiryPipeline.cs` `BuildNodes` (per-agent tool lists + shared budget), `IntakeExecutor.cs`, `CatalogTools.VerifyCatalogueTermAsync`, `Prompts/intake.md`, `tasks/task-foundry-03-intake-agent.md` Notes on completion.

**Decisions made:** Each agent's tools are named explicitly, not filtered from `ReadToolRegistry`; the old `!= "price_quote"` filter would have silently given Resolve the new tool. `Known` in `verify_catalogue_term` requires whole-word matches, so "ring" doesn't count as known just because it's inside "bearing". Intake uses the same light reasoning as Narrate; the live eval shows extraction is still correct. Ran `code-simplifier` in a worktree; its three cosmetic changes were merged by hand.

**Known gaps:** `Llm:UseStructuredOutput` is now read by nothing, and Intake runs without schema enforcement (the parse-retry still guards it). The live eval doesn't assert whether Intake called the tool on the clean worked example. Approvals suspended before the rename reference executor id `Extract` and may not resume. `verify_catalogue_term` doesn't search `Attributes`, so a thickness like "8mm" reports not known. Resolve's reasoning effort still untested (belongs to the Step 6 latency work).

**Blocked on Harsh:** (1) Commit foundry-03. (2) Decide `Llm:UseStructuredOutput`: delete it, or add schema enforcement on Intake's no-tool final turn. (3) Delete leftover `.claude/worktrees/` folder and branch `worktree-agent-a55cab43871bcb1b0` (my removal was denied); consider gitignoring `.claude/worktrees/`.

**Next:** `foundry-04` (image intake). Intake is the stage that reads photos, and the illegible-word photo is where a live `verify_catalogue_term` call should appear. Its one-image vs `Attachments[]` design gap (15 Sep entry) needs settling first.

## 2026-09-17 (cont.) — foundry-03 review follow-ups, latency measured, extras queued

**Done:** Code-reviewed and code-simplified the staged foundry-03 work (simplifier ran in an isolated worktree off an exported patch; its 4 no-behaviour tidy-ups applied). Fixed review finding 1: Intake gets its own tool-call cap (`Llm:IntakeMaxToolCalls` = 2, a child of the run's shared budget), so Resolve always keeps ≥ 8 of 10. Measured real latency with a temporary probe (3 live Foundry runs, deleted afterwards): **31 s average end to end, Resolve 25 s (~80%), 4.3 model round trips and 3.7 tool calls per run, final judgement turn ~10–11 s, both judgement calls correct 3/3**. `gpt-5-mini` never combines independent lookups into one turn. ~47k input / 8k output tokens for the 3 runs. foundry-03 + all of this is **staged, not committed**. Both builds clean; 145 unit + 54 integration tests green.

**Files that matter:** `tasks/README.md` (new carry-over note + Extras table), `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` Step 6 latency decision and new "Extras" section, `tasks/task-extra-01-line-picker.md`.

**Decisions made:** Keep the pipeline architecture as is. The "middle version" (routine customer + catalogue lookups in code in parallel, Resolve keeps the order-history decision; ~31 s → ~20 s est.) is presented in the video/document as a measured alternative, not built. Rejected: all lookups in code (Resolve would show no tool calls, weakening the agent claim and Foundry's tool-call-accuracy evaluation), lower Resolve reasoning (risks judgement), more tool calls or different models (per-stage models stay as they are). **Harsh's rule: nothing in the original plan is shrunk or cut for new ideas; new features are extras built only after foundry-04 → 08 all work on Foundry.** Extras queued: approval-card line picker (biggest Usability gap: a human cannot resolve an unclear line today), WhatsApp photo intake, faster Resolve, Impact evidence. Email intake not queued.

**Known gaps:** Review findings 2 and 3 are open and must be fixed at the start of foundry-04: `verify_catalogue_term` rejects misspellings ("tming belt") and family names ("SpindleTapes"). `Llm:UseStructuredOutput` still read by nothing. The live Foundry eval was not rerun after the Intake-cap fix (stub tests cover it; the worked example uses 0 Intake tool calls). Leftover git branches `worktree-agent-a55cab43871bcb1b0` / `worktree-agent-ae2e404d1374d4408` and possibly a `.claude/worktrees/` folder.

**Blocked on Harsh:** (1) Commit foundry-03. (2) `Llm:UseStructuredOutput`: delete, or schema-enforce Intake's final turn. (3) Delete the leftover worktree branches/folder; consider gitignoring `.claude/worktrees/`. (4) For extra-04 later: a real anonymised enquiry or a distributor's one-line quote. (5) Before foundry-04: one image or several per enquiry.

**Next:** `foundry-04` (image intake), starting with the two `verify_catalogue_term` carry-over fixes. Then 05 → 08 as planned; extras only after.

## 2026-09-17 (cont. 2) — Reviews of commit 2e10f06: fixes A–D

**Done:** Ran a code review, the code-simplifier and a security review on commit `2e10f06`. The built-in `/security-review` failed because this repo has no `origin/HEAD`, so a read-only agent did that review, scoped to the commit. Four fixes are staged, not committed:
- (A) a stale comment in `ResolveExecutor`.
- (B) `Llm:IntakeMaxToolCalls`/`MaxToolCalls` set to 0 no longer crash every run. The framework's round-trip limit is kept at 1 or more; the tool-call budgets still refuse the calls.
- (C) Prompt injection. The untrusted-content wrapper now breaks up `<<<`/`>>>` runs, so an enquiry can't close its block early. Resolve's prompt now wraps Intake's extracted company name and lines too. Before, a steered Intake could make Resolve look up another customer's order history via the company-name fallback.
- (D) The catalogue search escapes LIKE wildcards, so `%` or `__` no longer match every row.

Both builds clean; 153 unit + 61 integration tests green. Live Foundry eval passed in 40s after the prompt change.

**Decisions made:** The review's finding E needs Harsh's decision: approvals saved before the Extract→Intake rename can't be resumed. The framework matches the checkpoint's workflow shape. Checked the local DB: exactly 5 pending runs have the old shape (ids 1004–1007, 2002, all eval/probe runs). The 3 failed runs have no checkpoints and are unaffected.

**Known gaps:** The company-name fallback in customer matching is still a way to reach another customer's data if Intake is steered. The wrapper now makes that much harder, but it's worth an eval case in foundry-07's prompt-injection test.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Commit A–D. Decide E: mark the 5 old-shape runs failed, delete them, or leave them.

**Next:** `foundry-04` (image intake), starting with the `verify_catalogue_term` carry-over fixes.

**Addendum — finding E resolved (Harsh chose option 1):** marked the 5 old-shape pending runs (1004–1007, 2002) `failed` directly in the local DB: status, cleared `ApprovalRequestJson`, bumped `UpdatedAt`. Verified first that none has a stored trace, so `ProcessAsync` can never try to auto-resume them; a retry of those enquiries starts fresh. Local data only; CI and fresh clones seed from scratch and are unaffected. **Standing caution for later tasks:** changing a workflow executor's id, type or edges (e.g. while wiring OpenTelemetry in foundry-06) strands any approval pending at that moment in the same way. Clear or fail pending runs after such a change.

**Addendum — preventing stranded approvals (Harsh approved the recommendation):** plan is workflow version-stamping: a fingerprint of the pipeline shape stored on every run; a mismatch on resume expires the run cleanly; a startup sweep; a guard test for shape changes. It is **conditional in foundry-06**: first check whether its tracing work changes executor ids, types or edges. Build it there only if it does; otherwise it stays as extra-05. Recorded in the foundry-06 task file (new section + acceptance criterion), `tasks/README.md` extras, and `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` extras.

**Addendum — enquiry shape decided (answers the open "one image or several" question):** Harsh chose **both**. (1) One enquiry can be made of several parts, up to 5 photos plus 10 text messages, like a WhatsApp thread, read together into one quote. (2) Several enquiries can be submitted at once, each becoming its own quote. foundry-04 is rewritten for multi-part enquiries: an `EnquiryAttachments` child table; image bytes never in workflow messages or checkpoints, since Intake loads them by enquiry id. The new **foundry-04b** covers batches: sequential client-side loop over the existing endpoints, one card per enquiry, no new server endpoint. `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` §4c and `tasks/README.md` updated. This is materially more work than the single-image design. If the schedule slips, cut 04b before 04's multi-image support; the plan's existing cut order is otherwise unchanged.

**Addendum — reversed for time (supersedes the addendum above):** Harsh deferred multi-part and batch enquiries because of the deadline. **foundry-04 is back to its original one-photo plan**, plus a "Start here" section: the `verify_catalogue_term` carry-over fixes, and an early live check that `gpt-5-nano` reads a handwritten photo accurately. The multi-part and batch designs are kept as **extra-06** and **extra-07** (task files, README extras table, FOUNDRY-PLAN extras). There is no foundry-04b.
Per Harsh, the deferred plan was **not removed**. It is kept in `docs/FOUNDRY-PLAN.md` §4c under an "⏸ IGNORE FOR NOW" heading, and as `on hold` rows in the `tasks/README.md` queue pointing at the extra-06/07 task files.

## 2026-09-17 (cont. 3) — foundry-04: image intake (built; crafted-photo live check open)

**Done:** A pasted enquiry can carry one photo, and the body may be blank. The photo is downscaled in the browser, validated server-side (JPEG/PNG/WebP, 2 MB max, else 400), stored on `Enquiries.ImageDataUrl` and sent to Intake as image content. `IntakeExecutor` strips it, so no checkpoint carries it (a test scans every payload). `verify_catalogue_term` now suggests close catalogue phrases for misspellings ("PV belt" → "pu belt") and knows family names. Both builds clean, 182 unit + 69 integration tests green, web build passes. The migration is applied to the local dev DB. Staged, not committed.

**Files that matter:** `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Pipeline/IntakeExecutor.cs` (`BuildPrompt`, the strip), `src/QuoteDesk.Intake/PastedImage.cs`, `tests/QuoteDesk.Evals/FoundryImageIntakeEval.cs` (live check with per-call model, latency and tokens).

**Decisions made:**
- Status rule: blank body and no **readable** image → `needs_manual_entry`. The old attachment-only test (metadata only) stays unchanged and correct, and voice notes still need a human.
- An unreadable handwritten quantity is written as 0. Resolve's reconcile code makes any quantity ≤ 0 unresolved, so it is never priced.
- Suggestions never use SKU codes and never change digits.
- Intake stays at reasoning `None`. `Low` read the date correctly, but the run went from ~40 s to 66 s.

**Known gaps:**
- The live check used a synthetic handwriting-font image, not a photograph. nano read all quantities right 3/3 and the Intake call took 3.8–7.2 s, but it did **not** call `verify_catalogue_term` on a cleanly drawn "PV".
- With `None`, the date "need by 5th" was missed once. A date line was added to `intake.md`; its effect is not yet measured.
- Narrate (nano) once wrote "discount ₹20%" for an 8% line. The numbers are right; the sentence was wrong. This is for foundry-05/07.
- No browser test of the photo picker (needs Google sign-in).

**Blocked on Harsh:**
- (1) Commit the staged change.
- (2) Write and photograph the crafted demo list with a genuinely ambiguous letter, run it through the Desk, and check the trace for `verify_catalogue_term`.
- (3) If it still doesn't fire, decide: accept it, or raise Intake's reasoning/model (measured cost: ~25 s per run).

**Next:** close foundry-04's live check, then `foundry-05` (policy grounding), which also targets the Narrate misstatement.

**Correction (same session):** the "~25 s per run" cost of `Low` reasoning above is overstated. Per-stage timestamps show `Low` added ~5–10 s (Intake + Narrate, the only stages it applies to); the remaining ~17 s was Resolve varying between runs, and Resolve's reasoning is unchanged by that setting. Production is and was `LightStageReasoningEffort: None`; `appsettings.json` was never modified.

## 2026-09-17 (cont. 4) — foundry-04 closed: real-photo tests, model routing, reviews

**Done:**
- **Reviews and fixes:** three reviews (code review, security review, simplifier) on the first version, then one more code review and security review of everything after. All findings are fixed except the demo risks in SPEC §5.
- **Model routing:** Intake reads photos on `gpt-5-mini` (`Llm:IntakeImageModel`) and text on `gpt-5-nano`.
- **Approval card:** shows the customer's photo (`GET /api/enquiries/{id}/image`) with a "check against the photo" note.
- **Quantity guard:** a quantity Intake couldn't read can't be priced, even if Resolve fills one in.
- **Prompts:** no invented words; mixed Gujarati/Hindi rules; the prompt examples share no item with the demo.
- **Verified:** both builds clean, 201 unit + 80 integration tests pass, the web build passes, and the live Foundry text and photo evals pass. Everything is staged, not committed.

**Files that matter:** `docs/SPEC.md` §5 (the "Also resolved in foundry-04" list), `src/QuoteDesk.Agents/Pipeline/IntakeExecutor.cs` (`IntakeModels`), `src/QuoteDesk.Web/src/components/EnquiryPhoto.tsx`.

**Decisions made:**
- **Real photo, mini:** Harsh's messy handwritten photo showed mini misreading "20mm" as "25mm" (a real SKU, so it was priced green) and "2₹" (2RS) as "2F". Opus made the same "2Z" mistake.
- **No re-read loop:** we don't build a "re-read the photo" agent loop. The misreads are systematic, it adds cost, and it can't catch a confident misread. The human checks the photo instead.
- **Demo photo:** use clear handwriting. Keep the feature for messy photos.
- **What wins the hackathon:** a clear 3-minute video beats hidden complexity.
- **Extras:** WhatsApp only if 06–08 are done with a day left; multi-photo and batch are skipped for the hackathon.

**Known gaps:**
- `verify_catalogue_term` has never fired on a photo in a live run; check it with the demo photo while recording.
- Accepted demo risks (SPEC §5): any signed-in user can fetch any photo by id, there's no per-user upload cap, and `GetByIdAsync` loads the image column.
- Narrate (nano) still misstates discounts sometimes (foundry-05).
- The old leftovers `.claude/worktrees/agent-a55cab43871bcb1b0` and branches `worktree-agent-a55cab…`, `-aa3278…`, `-ae2e40…` are kept on Harsh's instruction.

**Blocked on Harsh:** Commit. CLAUDE.md forbids Claude running `git commit`.

**Next:** `/task foundry-05` (policy grounding). It also fixes Narrate's misstated discounts before anything is recorded.
